GeomeTRIC is a software package for molecular geometry optimization.
It is also the reference implementation of the translation-rotation internal coordinate system (TRIC).
Main features of geomeTRIC include:

* Energy minimization
* Constrained energy minimization
* Transition state optimization
* Nudged elastic band
* Conical intersection optimization
